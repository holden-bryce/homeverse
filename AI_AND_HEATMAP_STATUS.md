# AI Matching & Heatmap Functionality Status

## ‚úÖ What's Actually Implemented

### 1. **AI Matching Algorithm** (WORKING in Backend)
Located in `supabase_backend.py` starting at line 281

**Features:**
- `calculate_match_score()` function with weighted scoring:
  - **Income qualification** (40% weight) - Checks AMI eligibility
  - **Location proximity** (30% weight) - Calculates distance between applicant and project
  - **Household size fit** (20% weight) - Matches family size to project size
  - **Availability** (10% weight) - Checks if units are available

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/applicants/{applicant_id}/matches` - Get matched projects for an applicant
- `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/matches` - Get matched applicants for a project

### 2. **Heatmap Data Endpoint** (WORKING in Backend)
Located at line 612

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/analytics/heatmap`

**Returns:**
- Project locations with unit counts
- Demand zones based on applicant locations
- Statistics (total projects, applicants, units)

## üîß Issues to Fix

### 1. **Select Component Error**
- Empty string value in Select.Item components
- Need to find and fix Select components with `value=""`

### 2. **Company Assignment Issue**
- Users being created without company_id
- Frontend trying to handle this client-side (should be server-side)
- Projects can't be created without fixing company assignment

### 3. **Frontend Not Using These Features**
- Heatmap component exists but may not be calling the endpoint
- Matching features not exposed in UI
- Need to connect frontend to these backend endpoints

## üìç How to Fix

### 1. Fix Select Component Error
```tsx
// Find components with empty value
<Select.Item value=""> // BAD
<Select.Item value="none"> // GOOD
```

### 2. Fix Company Assignment
The server-side actions already handle this, but users might have been created before. Run this SQL:
```sql
-- Assign all users without companies to the default test company
UPDATE profiles 
SET company_id = '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111'
WHERE company_id IS NULL;
```

### 3. Connect Frontend to AI Features

**For Heatmap:**
```typescript
// In map component
const { data } = await fetch('/api/v1/analytics/heatmap', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

**For Matching:**
```typescript
// In applicant or project view
const { data } = await fetch(`/api/v1/applicants/${id}/matches`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

## üöÄ Quick Wins

1. The matching algorithm is FULLY IMPLEMENTED - just needs UI
2. Heatmap data is READY - just needs frontend connection
3. All the "AI" logic exists - it's a scoring algorithm, not ML, but it works!

The backend has much more functionality than the frontend is using!
