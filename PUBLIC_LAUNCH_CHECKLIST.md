# Public Launch Security & Readiness Checklist

## üîí Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ RLS (Row Level Security) is ENABLED
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Policies enforce company-based data isolation
- Users can only see/modify their company's data
- No security was compromised - we FIXED the policies

### Current RLS Rules:
1. **Profiles**: Users can only view/edit their own profile
2. **Companies**: Users can only view their assigned company
3. **Applicants**: Users can only access their company's applicants
4. **Projects**: Users can only access their company's projects
5. **Service Role**: Backend has admin access (secure)

## üö® Security Tasks Before Public Launch

### 1. Authentication Security
- [ ] Enable email verification for new signups
- [ ] Implement password complexity requirements
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- [ ] Enable 2FA for admin accounts
- [ ] Set up password reset flow with secure tokens

### 2. API Security
- [ ] Add API rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP)
- [ ] Implement request validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add API key authentication for external integrations
- [ ] Enable CORS for specific domains only (not "*")
- [ ] Add request logging for security auditing

### 3. Data Security
- [ ] Enable Supabase audit logging
- [ ] Implement data encryption for sensitive fields
- [ ] Add PII data masking in logs
- [ ] Set up automatic backups
- [ ] Create data retention policies

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Enable HTTPS everywhere (Render provides this)
- [ ] Set up WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- [ ] Configure DDoS protection
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Enable Supabase's built-in security features

## üìã Functional Completeness Checklist

### Core Features Working ‚úÖ
- User authentication and authorization
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Applicant management (CRUD)
- Project management (CRUD)
- Role-based dashboards
- Email notifications

### Features to Complete Before Launch
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Email verification for new users
- [ ] User invitation system
- [ ] Bulk data import/export
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Report generation
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

## üöÄ Pre-Launch Tasks

### 1. Code Security
```bash
# Run security audit
cd frontend && npm audit fix

# Check for exposed secrets
git secrets --scan

# Run OWASP dependency check
```

### 2. Environment Variables
- [ ] Remove all development/test credentials
- [ ] Rotate all API keys and secrets
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords
- [ ] Document all required env vars

### 3. Supabase Configuration
```sql
-- Enable additional security features
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET statement_timeout = '30s';
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '10min';

-- Create read-only role for analytics
CREATE ROLE analytics_reader;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO analytics_reader;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO analytics_reader;
```

### 4. Update CORS Settings
```python
# In supabase_backend.py, change from:
CORS_ORIGINS = ["*"]

# To:
CORS_ORIGINS = [
    "https://homeverse.com",
    "https://www.homeverse.com",
    "https://app.homeverse.com"
]
```

### 5. Add Rate Limiting
```python
# Install slowapi
pip install slowapi

# Add to backend
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["100 per minute"]
)
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)
```

## üîç Security Testing

### 1. Penetration Testing
- [ ] Test for SQL injection
- [ ] Test for XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test for CSRF attacks
- [ ] Test authentication bypass
- [ ] Test data leakage between tenants

### 2. Load Testing
- [ ] Test with 100 concurrent users
- [ ] Test with 1000 applicants per company
- [ ] Test file upload limits
- [ ] Test API rate limits

### 3. Compliance
- [ ] GDPR compliance (if serving EU users)
- [ ] SOC 2 readiness
- [ ] Data privacy policy
- [ ] Terms of service
- [ ] Cookie policy

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### 1. Application Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Sentry for error tracking
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Create custom alerts

### 2. Security Monitoring
- [ ] Failed login attempt alerts
- [ ] Unusual data access patterns
- [ ] API abuse detection
- [ ] Database query monitoring
