## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Steps

### 1. **Code Status**
- âœ… All changes committed
- âœ… Pushed to GitHub main branch
- âœ… Build tested and passing

### 2. **Render Deployment**
Your application will automatically redeploy on Render since it's connected to your GitHub repo. The deployment will:
1. Pull the latest code from GitHub
2. Build the backend with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Build the frontend with `npm install && npm run build`
4. Start services automatically

### 3. **Environment Variables to Verify**
Make sure these are set in Render dashboard:

**Backend (homeverse-api)**:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Add your SendGrid API key if you have one
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI matching features

**Frontend (homeverse-frontend)**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` - Already configured in .env.local

### 4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
Once deployed, test these features:
1. **Email**: Submit contact form and check backend logs
2. **Maps**: View project maps in buyer/developer portals
3. **Authentication**: Login with test accounts
4. **CRUD Operations**: Create/edit projects and applicants
5. **Export**: Test CSV export functionality
