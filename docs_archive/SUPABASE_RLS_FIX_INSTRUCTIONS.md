# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Supabase RLS Fix Required

The frontend is experiencing timeouts due to RLS (Row Level Security) policy issues in Supabase. Follow these steps to fix it:

## Quick Fix Instructions

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
   - Go to: https://vzxadsifonqklotzhdpl.supabase.co
   - Navigate to: SQL Editor (in the left sidebar)

2. **Run the RLS Fix**:
   - Copy ALL contents from `fix_rls_final.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL editor
   - Click "Run" button

3. **Verify Success**:
   - You should see: "Setup complete! Tables and policies are configured for frontend access."
   - If you see any errors, please share them

## What This Fixes

- âœ… Removes infinite recursion in profile policies
- âœ… Allows authenticated users to read profiles (required for navigation)
- âœ… Creates missing activity_logs table
- âœ… Simplifies policies to prevent timeouts
- âœ… Maintains security for write operations

## After Applying the Fix

1. The frontend at https://homeverse-frontend.onrender.com should work immediately
2. Users will be able to:
   - Login without timeout errors
   - See navigation sidebar based on their role
   - Create applicants and projects
   - Access all dashboard features

## Security Note

These policies are simplified for MVP functionality. Before production launch, you should:
- Implement proper company-based isolation
- Add more restrictive read policies
- Enable audit logging

## Test After Fix

Login with any test account:
- admin@test.com / password123
- developer@test.com / password123
- lender@test.com / password123
- buyer@test.com / password123
