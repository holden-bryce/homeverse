**Configuration**:
```python
# Add to supabase_backend.py
from sentry_sdk import init as sentry_init
sentry_init(dsn=SENTRY_DSN, environment=ENVIRONMENT)

# Health check endpoint
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

### 1.3 Security Hardening
**Required**:
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS protection

**Implementation**:
```python
from slowapi import Limiter
limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app.state.limiter = limiter

@app.post("/api/v1/applicants")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")
async def create_applicant(...):
```
