# HomeVerse Security Audit Results
*Generated: 6/27/2025*

## Summary
Analyzed the HomeVerse codebase after security fixes implementation. Found and fixed one syntax error. All security measures appear to be properly implemented.

## 1. Service Role Key Removal ✅
**Status**: PROPERLY REMOVED
- Service role key has been removed from `frontend/.env.local`
- Only the anonymous key (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) remains in frontend
- Service role key (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) is only used in backend environment

## 2. Next.js Version Update ✅
**Status**: UPDATED
- Next.js version: `14.2.30` in `frontend/package.json`
- This is an updated version from the 14.2.x series with security patches

## 3. CORS Configuration ✅
**Status**: PROPERLY CONFIGURED
- Environment-based CORS configuration implemented
- Development origins: `localhost:3000`, `localhost:3001`, `127.0.0.1:3000`
- Production origins: `homeverse-frontend.onrender.com`, `homeverse.com`, `www.homeverse.com`
- Proper methods, headers, and credentials settings
- Max age set to 3600 seconds

## 4. Rate Limiting Implementation ✅
**Status**: PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED
- Using `slowapi` for rate limiting
- Custom rate limit handler with user-friendly messages
- Key function uses authenticated user ID or IP address fallback
- Rate limits applied to sensitive endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/auth/register`: 3 per hour (prevent spam accounts)
  - `/api/v1/auth/login`: 5 per minute (prevent brute force)
  - `/api/v1/contact`: 3 per hour (prevent contact spam)
  - `/api/v1/applicants`: 30 per hour (reasonable data creation limit)
  - `/api/v1/upload/document`: 20 per hour (prevent storage abuse)

## 5. PII Encryption Implementation ✅
**Status**: PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED
- `PIIEncryption` class using Fernet symmetric encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation with SHA256
- 100,000 iterations for key stretching
- Environment-based encryption key and salt
- PII fields defined per table:
  - `applicants`: email, phone
  - `profiles`: phone
  - `contact_submissions`: email, phone
- Encryption/decryption methods for both strings and dictionaries
- Graceful handling of decryption failures

## 6. Syntax Errors Fixed ✅
**Issue Found**: Duplicate `Form` import on line 9
**Status**: FIXED
- Removed duplicate `Form` import from FastAPI imports
- Fixed all rate-limited endpoint signatures to include `request: Request` parameter
- All Python syntax validated successfully

## 7. Additional Security Features Observed ✅
- JWT authentication with Supabase
- Role-based access control
- Company-based multi-tenancy
- File upload validation with allowed extensions
- Secure password handling through Supabase Auth
- Activity logging for audit trails
- Email notification preferences with opt-out support

## Recommendations
1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure production deployment has proper encryption keys set (not using defaults)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor rate limit effectiveness and adjust as needed based on usage patterns
3. **PII Fields**: Consider adding SSN to encryption fields if/when that feature is implemented
4. **HTTPS**: Ensure all production deployments use HTTPS only
5. **Security Headers**: Consider adding security headers like HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options

## Conclusion
The security fixes have been properly implemented. The application now has:
- ✅ Proper secret management (service key removed from frontend)
- ✅ Updated dependencies (Next.js security patches)
- ✅ Environment-specific CORS configuration
- ✅ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- ✅ PII encryption for sensitive data
- ✅ No syntax errors

The codebase is ready for deployment with these security enhancements.
