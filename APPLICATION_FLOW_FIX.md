# Application Flow Fix Documentation

## Issue
Buyer-submitted applications were not visible to developers in their dashboard.

## Root Cause
The applications page was using the same filtering logic for all user roles. Developers need to see all applications for their company's projects, not just their own applications.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Fix (`/dashboard/applications/page.tsx`)
Modified the applications query to use role-based filtering:
- **Buyers/Applicants**: Filter by their email (see only their own applications)
- **Developers/Admins**: No email filter (see all company applications)

```typescript
const filters = profile?.role === 'developer' || profile?.role === 'admin' 
  ? { status: statusFilter === 'all' ? undefined : statusFilter }
  : { status: statusFilter === 'all' ? undefined : statusFilter, email: user?.email }
```

### 2. Backend Already Correct
The backend (`supabase_backend.py`) already implements proper role-based filtering:
- Applications are created with the correct `company_id`
- Developers can see all applications for their company's projects
- Email notifications are sent to developers when new applications arrive

## How It Works Now

### For Buyers:
1. Submit application via `/dashboard/buyers/apply/[id]`
2. Application is saved with their applicant info and the project's company_id
3. Can view their own applications at `/dashboard/buyers/applications`

### For Developers:
1. View all applications at `/dashboard/applications`
2. See applications for all projects in their company
3. Can update application status (approve/reject/review)
4. Receive email notifications for new applications

## Testing the Fix

1. **As a Buyer**:
   - Login as `buyer@test.com`
   - Apply to a project
   - Check "My Applications" to see your submission

2. **As a Developer**:
   - Login as `developer@test.com`
   - Go to Applications page
   - See all applications including the buyer's submission
   - Update application status

## Database Structure
Applications are properly linked:
- `applications.project_id` → `projects.id`
- `applications.applicant_id` → `applicants.id`
- `applications.company_id` → `companies.id` (for multi-tenant isolation)

## Email Notifications
When a buyer submits an application:
- All developers in the company receive an email notification
- Email includes project details and applicant information
- Developers can click link to review the application

## Summary
The fix ensures proper visibility of applications based on user roles while maintaining data isolation between companies. Buyers see only their applications, while developers see all applications for their company's projects.
