# HomeVerse Functionality Test Report

**Test Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Environment**: Local Development  
**Backend**: Supabase Backend (supabase_backend.py)  
**Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript  

## Executive Summary

Backend and frontend servers start successfully. Authentication works for all 5 user roles. However, several API endpoints are missing or have issues with the Supabase integration.

## Test Results

### ✅ Working Features (6/17 tests passed - 35.3%)

1. **Health Check** - Backend is responsive
2. **Authentication** - All 5 user roles can login successfully:
   - Developer login ✅
   - Lender login ✅
   - Buyer login ✅
   - Applicant login ✅
   - Admin login ✅

### ❌ Issues Found (11/17 tests failed)

1. **User Profile Endpoints** (404 Not Found)
   - `/api/v1/auth/me` endpoint is missing
   - Affects all user roles

2. **Authorization Issues** (401 Unauthorized)
   - Creating applicants fails - profile data missing in Supabase
   - Creating projects fails - profile data missing in Supabase
   - Error: "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned"

3. **Missing Endpoints** (404 Not Found)
   - `/api/v1/analytics/heatmap` - Analytics not implemented
   - `/api/v1/users/settings` - User settings not implemented
   - `PATCH /api/v1/users/settings` - Settings update not implemented

4. **Validation Issues** (422 Unprocessable Entity)
   - Contact form submission fails validation

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Profile Data**: Test users exist in Supabase Auth but don't have corresponding profile records in the profiles table
2. **Incomplete API**: Several endpoints referenced in CLAUDE.md are not implemented in supabase_backend.py
3. **Schema Mismatch**: Contact form expects different fields than what's being sent

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Create profile records for test users in Supabase
   - Implement missing `/api/v1/auth/me` endpoint
   - Fix contact form validation

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement analytics endpoints
   - Add user settings management
   - Complete CRUD operations for applicants/projects

3. **Long-term**:
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement remaining features mentioned in CLAUDE.md
   - Add automated tests to CI/CD pipeline

## Server Status

- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:8000 ✅
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000 ✅
- **Database**: Connected to Supabase ✅
- **API Documentation**: Available at http://localhost:8000/docs ✅

## Test Credentials Used

All test accounts use password: `password123`
- developer@test.com
- lender@test.com
- buyer@test.com
- applicant@test.com
- admin@test.com

## Conclusion

The core infrastructure is operational with successful authentication. However, significant work is needed to implement missing endpoints and fix data issues before the application can be considered fully functional.
